# Dreampad | Autism Screening Tool for Sri Lankans

<!--[![N|Solid]()](https://vindula-ya.github.io/dreampad.io/)-->

In Sri Lankan sociocultural context, Down syndrome, Autism & other disabilities are the topics which are not spoken out openly. This has led to the discrimination of special needs children among society & commonly labelled these kids as bringing misfortune to the families. Most of the occasions they are bullied & cornered in the society. Acceptance from own family is low due to the less awareness of these health & mental conditions of special needs children. Further, most of the parents intentionally giving a low focus on the development & other requirements of these special needs children with the perception that they are under-privileged from birth itself.
Current education system in Sri Lanka does not provide a specific curriculums & focus in schools for special needs children, therefore they have to undergo the same curriculum in the normal class room environment with no shadow teachers available. Since no specific attention granted & having a longer learning curve leads to a stop for formal education for most of the special needs children after one or two years of their education. This further narrows down the opportunity to develop themselves to have an improved life style.

>Dreampad is a research based application which driven by the tag line ‘giving life for live’ is focusing on creating a better world for special needs children in Sri Lanka.

The main ways and means of doing this will be by introducing a structured mechanism to tackle every aspect that are challenging to develop special needs children to be accepted & included in their own family and in society as a whole. Our screening application covers:
  - Eye Contacts
  - Respondings
  - Vocal Behaviours
  - Questionnier 

# Future Developemnts |

  - Comprehensive development of IOS application.
  - Increase the accuracy level of the predictions.
  - Implementing a eye gaze detection framework for healthcare applications.

Dreampad is a application not a library so we gain no adoption benefits by allowing linking to proprietary code. Some porgram  code is part of (http://romanhosek.cz/android-eye-detection-updated-for-opencv-2-4-6/).
The first couple commits of openCV libraries and program code before we developed any computer vision were released under the MIT licence though.


**Happy Coding!!**
